## Improve Code

### Inline Chat to refactor Update Method

1. Go to FlightsController `Update` method

2. Start inline chat with Copilot

```
Refactor this method to make it more readable and maintainable
```

3. Refactored code is very hard to understand through inline chat.

### Inline Chat through a small change (name change)

1. Select the `Update` method

2. Start inline chat with Copilot

```
Rename this method
```

3. Copilot suggests renaming the method to `UpdateFlightStatus`

### Try refactoring again through Copilot Chat

1. Go to FlightsController `Update` method

2. Start Copilot Chat

```
#selection Improve this method to make it more readable and maintainable
```

3. Show how Copilot suggests the improvement

4. Note that Copilot is not perfect and sometimes suggests incorrect code
